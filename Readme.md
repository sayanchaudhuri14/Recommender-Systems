## Recommendation Systems

Use the movielens data set from here:

https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/.

There are 2 data sets, small and large. Use both datasets.

Do the following for each dataset:
1. Apply SVD on each of these data sets.
2. Apply CUR decomposition to these datasets.
3. Plot the error versus number of latent factors.
4. Plot the storage and compute time.
5. Apply PQ decomposition or the machine learning approach to matrix factorization. Do a 80:20 split of your data into training and test data. Apply stochastic gradient descent from scratch with regularization.
6. Try the generalized neural collaborative filtering approach.
